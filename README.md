## Background

The Department of Labor (“DOL”) Wage and Hour Division (“WHD”) is engaged in an effort to modernize their paper-based system of processing applications for 14(c) certificates by developing an electronic replacement known as the 14(c) Web Application Tool.
 
Section 14(c) of the Fair Labor Standards Act (“FLSA”) permits the payment of subminimum wages -- wages less than the general minimum wage -- to workers with disabilities whose earning or productive capacity is impaired by a disability for the work to be performed, after the employer has applied for and received an authorizing certificate from DOL.
 
Once in production, the 14(c) Web Application Tool allows employers to apply for 14(c) certificates through an online interface. The online interface has already been created along with an API that will allow for it to be connected to a backend database and/or application.
 
The primary purpose of this project is to modify existing features and to develop new features for the 14(c) Web Application Tool and the associated API.

This application must be centered on the needs of its *end users*, including:
- Employers who submit 14(c) certificate applications through the online interface
- DOL WHD personnel who need to track, review, and update submitted applications as they move through the review and approval process
- Administrators who will control authorization to view the 14(c) applications

### What we're hoping to end up with

To fulfill the objectives for performance of this task order, the Vendor must meet the user needs described in the following subsections. Please note that, in subsequent sprints, we may refine these objectives to ensure we’re continually meeting user needs. In agreement with the product owner, we may modify, add, retract, or reprioritize user stories to reflect additional research.
 
This requirement is the development and expansion of an existing front-end application and API that will allow employers to apply for a 14(c) certificate from DOL and will allow DOL WHD personnel to display, view, update, and modify pertinent information regarding 14(c) applications submitted by employers seeking certifications. To satisfy the needs of DOL WHD, the following deliverables must be provided by the conclusion of performance.
