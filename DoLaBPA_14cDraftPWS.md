# PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT (PWS) For the Department of Labor,
# Wage and Hour Division
# Section 14(c) System

## [DATE]

## 1.0 BACKGROUND

The Department of Labor (DOL), Wage and Hour Division (WHD) will further improve the accomplishment of its mission by refining internal and external standards to unify policy, certification, enforcement and certificate holder operations under Section 14(c) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (Section 14(c)). WHD will issue and enforce Section 14(c) certificates to ensure they are only held by employers who comply with all program standards and will work to ensure individuals are knowledgeable of their Section 14(c) rights, as well as competitive integrated employment options.

## 2.0 OBJECTIVES

The 14(c) system will become a modern, digital-first service. Applicants will be provided an intuitive online experience, guiding them through the information needed to complete their application correctly. Applicants will have the ability to save their progress along the way, submit it to the system and see their application status. The application data will be made available to WHD users to inform certification and enforcement decisions. Applicants will have access to previous applications in order to apply for renewal. The product will support policy and process evolution over time, and will support data transparency wherever and however possible.

These user needs shall be met in order to fulfill the objectives for performance of this task order, and may be refined by later sprints to continuously meet user needs. User needs are prioritzed based on need here in a [Trello board] (https://trello.com/b/74MUGMpP).

#### Applicants:
- As an Employer, I would like to have my existing certifications associated with my account so that I can view them or renew them.

Work on this project may require that personnel have access to Privacy
Information. Personnel shall adhere to the Privacy Act, Title 5 of the
U.S. Code, Section 552a and applicable agency rules and regulations.

### 6.8 Government Furnished Items

The Government will furnish the data and scripts needed at time of
award. No other hardware or software will be provided by the Government.

### 6.9 18F Transparency Policy

Vendors are advised that 18F will publish on a publicly available
website documents associated with this requirement, including any
Requests for Quotation (including amendments), Question and Answer
exchanges with vendors (source-identifying information removed), and
other relevant information that is not confidential/proprietary in
nature or source selection sensitive information that would otherwise
implicate procurement integrity concerns. Upon award, 18F will publish
the total price of the selected proposal and certain
non-source-identifying data (e.g., the number of bids, the mean price,
median, and standard deviation of price). During the performance of
this task order, 18F will similarly publish source code, data related
to project management (e.g., user stories, milestones, and performance
metrics), and top-line spending data.

### 6.10 Data Rights and Ownership of Deliverables

It is 18F's intent that any data or deliverable created as a result of
the work performed under the task order be committed to the public
domain.

It is the intention of 18F to commit the following, but not limited
to, items to the public domain: all data, documents, graphics and code
created under this task order including but not limited to, plans,
reports, schedules, schemas, metadata, architecture designs, and the
like; new open source software created by the contractor and forks or
branches of current open source software where the contractor has made
a modification; new tooling, scripting configuration management,
infrastructure as code, or any other final changes or edits to
successfully deploy or operate the software.

The contractor shall use open source technologies wherever possible, in
support of the 18F Source Code Policy. All licenses must be expressly
listed in the deliverable. Regardless of license(s) used (e.g., MIT,
GPL, Creative Commons 0) the license(s) shall be clearly listed in the
documentation.

If the contractor needs to use work that does not have an open source
license, the contractor is required to request permission from 18F, in
writing, before utilizing that work in any way in connection with the
order. If approved, all licenses shall be clearly set forth in a
conspicuous place when work is delivered to 18F.

If an open source license provides implementation guidance, the
contractor shall ensure compliance with that guidance. If implementation
guidance is not available, the contractor shall attach or include the
license within the work itself. Examples of this include code comments
at the beginning of a file or contained in a license file within a
software repository.

### 6.11 GSA AAS Business Systems (AASBS) Web Portal

The GSA AASBS (Assisted Acquisition Services Business Systems also known

contractor during the performance of the task order and be used in the
administration of the task order. This web-based system at
https://portal.fas.gsa.gov/web/guest shall be used by the contractor to
upload status reports, deliverables, invoices, and to respond to
inquiries. The contractor shall maintain a current account on this
system.
