# PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT (PWS) For the Department of Labor
# Wage and Hour Division
# Section 14(c) Tool

## [DATE]

## 1.0 BACKGROUND

The Department of Labor (DoL) Wage and Hour Division (WHD) will further improve the accomplishment of its mission by establishing a consistent set of internal and external standards that unifies Section 14(c) policy, certification, enforcement and certificate holder operations. WHD will issue and enforce 14(c) certificates to ensure they are only held by employers who comply with all program standards and will work to ensure individuals are knowledgeable of 14(c) rights and competitive integrated employment options.

## 2.0 OBJECTIVES

The 14(c) process will become a modern, digital-first service. Applicants will be provided an intuitive online experience, guiding them through the information needed to complete their application correctly. Applicants will have the ability to save their progress along the way, submit it to the system and see their application status. The application data will be made available to WHD users to inform certification and enforcement decisions. The product will support policy and process evolution over time, and will support data transparency wherever and however possible.

These user needs shall be met in order to fulfill the objectives for performance of this task order, and may be refined by later sprints to continuously meet user needs.

#### Applicants:
- As an Applicant, I want to submit my application via a web form so that the submission process is quicker and I no longer have to mail my application. AC: Data will end up in a database. AC: The applicant must be logged in.
- As an Applicant, I want conditional logic to ensure I only have to complete relevant sections so that the time it takes to complete the application is reduced.
- As an Applicant, I want current links to compliance assistance materials (resources, suggestions, worksheets, data, etc.), so that I can complete the application correctly.
- As an Applicant, I want the ability to log-in, so that the system knows who I am and my information is secure.
- As an Applicant, I want the ability to save and retrieve my application in progress so I can work on the form in more than one session.
- As an Applicant, I want certain form fields to be pre-populated with previously used information when I begin a renewal application so that it takes less time to complete the application.
- As an Applicant, I want to receive receipt confirmation and status updates via email notifications, so that I know where my application is in the process.
- As an Applicant I want to be able to upload required documents (time studies) so that I submit a complete application.

#### Certifying Parties:
- As a Certification Team Member and as an Applicant, I want a system that performs preliminary data validation checks on fields that have predetermined or controlled answers (i.e. dates, rates, etc.), so that proper information is submitted and the certification team member spends more time analyzing the more substantive part of the application.
- As a Certification Team Manager and a Policy Team Member, I want access to all submitted application data, so that I can continuously evaluate and improve current policy and procedures. AC: Data should be sort-able, searchable and able to produce reports. AC: It should take no longer than 1 minute to pull reports.
- As a Certification Team Member and a Certification Team Manager, I need a system that will only allow submission of a complete application (i.e. all applicable fields answered and documents attached), so that I can more effectively use time reviewing applications.
- As a Certification Team Member, I need a system that allows me to easily navigate within it (logical tabbing, multiple screen use, etc.) so that I can work in a more efficient manner.
- As a Certification Team Member and a Certification Team Manager, I want to be able to document issues/potential violations in an internal diary sheet (saved in historical record) so that systemic problems can be identified and analyzed.
- As a Certification Team Manager and a a Policy Team Member, I want the system to produce trend data, so that I can make effective strategic enforcement decisions.
- As a Certification Team Manager and a Policy Team Member I want to be able to access diary sheets so that I can review potential systemic violations.
- As a Certification Team Manager, I want the system to assign applications based on set criteria, so that the process is more streamlined.
- As a Certification Team Manager I want to be able to assign/reassign work so that the workload is balanced.
- As a Certification Team Manager, Policy Team Member, Certification Team Member, and Non-WHD Interested Party, I want to be able to get descriptive data about the inventory of active and pending certificates so that I understand the current 14(c) universe.
- As a Certification Team Manager and a Policy Team Member, I need a system that has user friendly reporting functions so that I can provide information upon request (FOIA, etc).
- As a Certification Team Manager and a Policy Team Member, I want to track inventory so that I can provide reports/status updates to interested WHD parties.
- As a Certification Team Member, a Certification Team Manager and a Policy Team Member, I want access to employer application/certificate history within the system, so that I can review the employer's 14(c) history.
- As a Certification Team Member, a Certification Team Manager and a Policy Team Member, I would like to be able to access the applicant's enforcement history from WHISARD within the system, so that the data can be used to inform the certification decision and so that staff spends less time researching and entering information.
- As a Certification Team Member and a Certification Team Manager, I want the system to communicate with CPS and WHISARD to perform a validity check on the EIN number provided by the employer on the submitted application.
- As a Certification Team Manager, a Certification Team Member and a a Policy Team Member, I want the system to flag all previously denied or revoked applicants, so that "bad actors" are not issued certificates.
- As a Certification Team Member, I need a system that allows me to create reports of my workload, organize calendar events and report time spent on activities (WH-40), so that I can manage my work.
- As a Certification Team Manager I want the system to track specialist time and transfer information to the WH-40 so that time is appropriately charged against a case.
- As a Certification Team Manager, I want productivity data (number of applications processed, length of time from receipt to decision, etc.) of each specialist so that I can evaluate performance, restructure processes and make other improvements.
- As a Policy Team member, Certification Team Manager and Applicant, I want the system to provide the online calculators as an option, so that standard and accurate information is submitted.
- As a Certification Team Manager and a Policy Team Member, I want data that shows where applicants struggle to complete the application, so that we understand where additional compliance assistance is needed and/or where we might target for strategic enforcement.
- As a WHI, I need a system that easily tells me the status of an application and allows me to retrieve application data so that I can effectively perform the investigation.
- As a WHD Field Manager, I want to be able to check certificate and application status so that I take correct enforcement action.

#### Parent:
- As a Parent, I want to know if my child's employer holds a certificate so that I know the employer has the right to pay less than the minimum wage.

    Manager, reporting problems to the Procurement Project Manager as
    they occur (not waiting for a monthly meeting).

-   Do not permit government officials to interview potential contractor
    employees, discuss individual performance, approve leave or work
    scheduling of contractor employees, terminate contractor
    employees, assist contractor employees in doing their jobs or
    obtain assistance from the contractor in doing Government job.

### 6.10 Data Rights and Ownership of Deliverables

It is 18F's intent that any data or deliverable created as a result of
the work performed under the task order be committed to the public
domain.

It is the intention of 18F to commit the following, but not limited
to, items to the public domain: all data, documents, graphics and code
created under this task order including but not limited to, plans,
reports, schedules, schemas, metadata, architecture designs, and the
like; new open source software created by the contractor and forks or
branches of current open source software where the contractor has made
a modification; new tooling, scripting configuration management,
infrastructure as code, or any other final changes or edits to
successfully deploy or operate the software.

The contractor shall use open source technologies wherever possible, in
support of the 18F Source Code Policy. All licenses must be expressly
listed in the deliverable. Regardless of license(s) used (e.g., MIT,
GPL, Creative Commons 0) the license(s) shall be clearly listed in the
documentation.

If the contractor needs to use work that does not have an open source
license, the contractor is required to request permission from 18F, in
writing, before utilizing that work in any way in connection with the
order. If approved, all licenses shall be clearly set forth in a
conspicuous place when work is delivered to 18F.

If an open source license provides implementation guidance, the
contractor shall ensure compliance with that guidance. If implementation
guidance is not available, the contractor shall attach or include the
license within the work itself. Examples of this include code comments
at the beginning of a file or contained in a license file within a
software repository.
