8. Basis of Award and Evaluation Criteria

 This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR Subpart 8.4, Federal Supply Schedules. This is not a FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation, procurement. All contractor submissions in response to this RFQ are considered quotations and not proposals or offers, even if labeled as such. The offerors agree to and are bound by all instructions, procedures and rules of this RFQ. The Government is not obligated to determine a competitive range, conduct discussions, solicit final revised quotations, and use other techniques associated with FAR part 15. The contracting techniques associated with FAR Part 15 do not apply.

 Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose quotation conforms to the RFQ and is determined to provide the best value to the Government, considering the evaluation factors outlined below. The non-cost/price evaluation factors, when combined, are significantly more important than cost/price. However, as technical ratings become more equal, price will increase in importance in the award decision. Based on a “best value” determination, utilizing the trade-off process, the Government may make the award to the offeror submitting other than the lowest priced quotation or offeror submitting a quotation with other than the highest technical merit.

 **Technical**

 The Government shall evaluate the requirements for an Offeror’s performance or capability acceptability based on the following non-price technical factors which are of equal importance to each other.

 -   Technical Understanding and Approach
 -   Key Personnel
 -   Similar Experience

  **Price**

  Each Offeror’s price quotation will be evaluated separately from the technical quotation. The Government will evaluate the Offeror’s proposed price to ensure that the offered price is fair, reasonable, and realistic. Pricing shall reflect reasonableness, consistency with industry standards, and be in compliance with rates and terms and conditions of the BPA.

9. Evaluation Process

 The Government intends to utilize a multiphased approach for this procurement described below.

 Phase 1: Compliance Check. The Contracting Officer will review all offers to ensure compliance with the instructions and requirements set forth in the solicitation. Offerors that are not compliant with the solicitation will not be considered in the next phase.

 Phase 2: Review of Written Technical Quotations and Oral Presentations. The Offeror’s written technical quotation and responses to questions asked during the Oral Presentations will be evaluated based on an assessment by the Government technical evaluation team of their strengths, weaknesses, and risks associated with the technical factors described above. After each oral presentation, the evaluation team will assess the technical merits of their proposal and select the vendor that demonstrates, in GSA's determination, the greatest understanding of the Government's requirements as described in the PWS, has the proper mix of technical expertise to satisfy the requirements, and does not exhibit weaknesses that would affect the vendor's ability to satisfy the requirements.

 Following the technical evaluations, price will be introduced and a best value decision will be made in accordance with Section 8 above. The Government does not intend to use any adjectival ratings for thi procurement and will provide a brief explanation in accordance wit FAR 8.405-2(d) to unsuccessful offerors upon timely request.
